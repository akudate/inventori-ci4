<p align="center">The GNT-0000 00 Qan[T] (aka 00Q, 00 Qan[T], pronounced "Double-Oh Quanta") is the successor to the GN-0000+GNR-010 00 Raiser.<br><br>

A fifth Generation Gundam designed and tuned specifically for Celestial Being's first Innovator, Gundam Meister Setsuna F. Seiei, 00 Qan[T] is the latest mobile suit (MS) designed by Celestial Being. Its blueprints originated from an Innovators draft and was sent over from Veda/Tieria (with level 7 clearance) for Celestial Being engineers to analyze and develop. As the successor to GN-0000+GNR-010 00 Raiser, 00 Qan[T] contains an upgraded and improved Twin Drive System and possesses the new Quantum System. Whereas Zabanya and Harute were developed using parts from their predecessors, 00 Qan[T]'s was made as a new mobile suit. The development resources and focus used on 00 Qan[T] is that of a higher level than the other two.<br><br>

The unit possesses two newly created GN Drives specifically made for its Twin Drive System. The drives are located on its back and underneath the shield respectively and were developed by a team led by Linda Vashti at Jupiter. As these newly made solar furnaces are developed with perfect synchronization in mind, no external help with stabilization is required, thus 00 Qan[T] does not need a support unit such as 0 Raiser like 00 Gundam did. They can also be directly connected with each other which would result in a higher sync rate and output, however when used this way they become extremely hard to control. To prevent unexpected problems, they are usually kept separated.
